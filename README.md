In this project we analyse a simple dataset from the real estate industry. 
We perform some exploratory data analysis, perform hypothesis testing and create a simple linear regression to understand the relationship between average rooms and the median home value.
1. Data analysis
   Here we read and explore the data using summary statistics and descriptive statistics. We look for missing variables, as well as compute the mean, mode and median of our numerical variables. We also compute a correlation matrix to find the variable with the highest correlation to price.
2. Data visualization
   We limit the visualization portion of the project to creating a histogram of the distribution of median home values.
